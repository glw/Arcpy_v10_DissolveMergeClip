Arcpy_v10_DissolveMergeClip
===========================

Arcpy (v10) Will dissolve polygons within a shapefiles, merge them together and then clip them according to a boundary shapefile 

This is not the most efficient script...you have to input the shp files by hand. But this was a first attempt at Arcpy for myself. I will continue to improve it as time allows.

One more step I need to take for this workflow is to merge the clipped areas back togther with their appropriate names added to the attributes.
